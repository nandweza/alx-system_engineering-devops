<h2>Background Context</h2>
<br>
<p>The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!).</p>
<p>Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.</p>
<p>In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.</p>
